A few months ago, I watched the documentary [“Get Involved!”](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/get-involved) by Rob Conery and Scott Hanselman. It is available as a free video course from Pluralsight. In the feature, Rob and Scott provide advice on becoming a “social programmer” in order to enhance one’s career prospects.

Below are my thoughts on the different channels they talk about.

## Blogging
This is definitely my favorite medium. In my opinion, blogging helps me improve my writing while also providing a means to archive the knowledge that I am acquiring on a daily basis. On the other hand, it is not without challenges. I find it difficult to come up with good topics to blog about. Additionally, I often feel self-conscious about my writing style and the level of my knowledge of the topic I am writing about.

## Twitter
There is an excellent walk through of this service in the documentary. I must admit that I stayed away from Twitter till recently. I was not sure that I wanted to deal with the flood of information given that I can barely keep up with my email. Also, the ephemeral nature of the medium makes it a very synchronous activity drawing away focus from anything else I may have going on. I finally [signed up](https://twitter.com/sujithpl) but I am not very active yet.

## GitHub
This is probably the best option to showcase my programming abilities. I can help other open source projects or publish my own projects. While I have [some work](https://github.com/sujithpl) uploaded, I plan to be more active in the future.

## StackOverflow
I use it a lot but have no interest in being a contributor.

## Events
This includes the big conferences as well as regional user groups. As a regular participant in several local meetups, I have been getting value from networking and learning about new things. However, I realize that the real key to building authority and reputation is by being a presenter. I plan to do that soon, starting with lightning talks.

## Others Not Mentioned
- **Slack:** The local developer community is very active and I contribute where I can.
- **LinkedIn:** While I have been sharing short blurbs and links, I have not yet utilized the option to publish long form posts.
- **Medium:** This is definitely the blogging platform of choice at the moment. I am staying away just because I don’t have the time to create separate unique content for it.
- **Book:** This is one of the highest forms of achievement especially if published traditionally. I do dream of doing it one day.

At this point in my career, my primary focus is on learning. However I do realize that I need to build and maintain a public profile as a programmer and that process can take a while. So I have been allocating some of my precious time to blogging, putting up code on GitHub and attending local Meetups of interest whenever I can.
