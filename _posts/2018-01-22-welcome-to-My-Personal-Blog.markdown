When I first learned about the ability to host a blog on GitHub using a static site generator such as [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), I thought it was cool but not for me.
I already had a [WordPress blog](https://wordpress.org) with my hosting provider. That setup came with a lot of useful plugins including SEO optimization and moderated comments. 
I did not see the value in using a new platform that seemed to be less powerful.

But after a few months of using WordPress, I realized that it was a little too heavyweight for my needs. The work flow involved in creating a new post also felt more 
involved than it has to be. Additionally, the simplicity of a static site appealed to the minimalist in me.

So as an experiment, I am starting this blog on GitHub. If I find this experience more convenient and the results effective, then I might move here permanently.
