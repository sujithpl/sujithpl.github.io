Like almost everyone else, I feel like I never have enough time to do all the things I want to do. I am always on the lookout for effective time management techniques.  So when I attended the [QuickBooks Connect](https://quickbooksconnect.com) conference in 2016, I was naturally drawn to the session "The 25th hour: 7 strategies for adding time to your day, for your business and for you". The presenter, [Melissa d'Arabian](http://www.melissadarabian.net), shared some very practical suggestions on the topic. In this blog post, I will describe my takeaways.

## Priorities
The key to an effective time management strategy is to figure out what is important to you.  Once you determine your "life mission", you put that first and plan the rest of your time around it. This matters because when you say "yes" to something, you are implicitly saying "no" to a million other things.

## Schedule
Start your day with what's important to you, not to others. For example, don't open your emails the first thing in the morning. Instead study, reflect or write. A good technique to help with this is to plan and set up everything in advance the previous night.
