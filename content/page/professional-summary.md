title: Professional Summary
---

I am a Software Engineer specializing in building RESTful APIs on Open Source stacks using Java, Spring, JAX-RS and JPA. I am passionate about building software solutions that are right-sized, bloat-free, robust and maintainable. I am currently focused on learning Golang and expanding my knowledge of AWS. As far as my technical background goes, I have worked on a wide variety of platforms and applications including Unix/Linux, Mainframes, Relational Databases, Data Warehouses, ETL processes, Rules Engines and Web Services. I also have hands on coding experience with JavaScript, Python, Ruby, SQL, bash shell scripts, C/C++ and VBA.

In my previous role as a Business Systems Analyst, I used to work closely with the Intent Owner to elicit and refine the Business Requirements of the problem. Then I turned around and collaborated with the technology team to define the optimal Solution Design. I stayed involved in the delivery process through development, testing and implementation. Along the way, I have managed teams and platforms. I have experience with audits and controls, risk management, configuration management, change management and domain target architecture. I have been recognized as a Subject Matter Expert on internal business applications and processes.

Though I have a lot of experience with Waterfall style delivery, I currently utilize the Agile Scrum methodology at work. I have worked on creating Epics and Features on a Product Backlog and decomposing them into Stories and Tasks that are completed during Sprints. I am comfortable leading team ceremonies such as Scrum, Planning, Demos and Retrospectives. I am also familiar with Extreme Programming technical practices such as Pair Programming, Test Driven Development (TDD), Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD) and Continuous Integration.
