title: About Me
---

I have been fascinated by computers and the internet since I was about 10 years old. I now [work in the software development field](/page/professional-summary) as a consultant.

In this blog, I will be mostly writing about software engineering, hardware advances, business, science, technology and their social impacts.

Opinions expressed are solely my own and do not express the views or opinions of my employer or clients.
